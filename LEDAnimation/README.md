# LED Lightshow: Morse Code Animation

In this assignment, I created an interactive light show. It takes a morse code inputed by the user and translates it into light. 
The user is given a link to a Morse code translator page. In that page they can turn their phrase into morse. They copy the output into the code. And the lightshow begins!

This code is a very simple light assignment on CircuitPython.

### Difficulties: 

1. I do not know how to turn the Morse code translator page into an active link, the user can click on directly. 
2. I started out the code without defining any functions. It would have been very time consuming and would not be able to take user input. 
3. I had a difficult time finding a way to end the code. After enumerating through the characters. So I appended every character from the string after it was read, then once the string was empty, I prompted the user for a new input. 

### Next Steps:

To take this code further, I think adding sound to match the blinks would make it a lot more understandable and easier to follow. And a better way to avoid links is to create a whole Morse code translator built into the code. That way the user types in their phrase normally.
